# ShareX2Server
### *Little Intro*
ShareX2Server is a tiny (yet probably bloated, I don't need half the packages in here) server backend that allows a user to upload screenshots to their own server. Shout out to [Haroon](https://github.com/DaInfLoop) for the original project and [Avery](https://github.com/buddy-codes) for refreshing me on EJS after at least 2 years.
### *Setup*
I'll get around to writing this sooner than later. In the meantime, you should be able to parse through most of this junk.
### *About that file_uploads folder...*
This repo is currently hooked up to a [Repl](https://replit.com/@bramley/media) on Replit that is acting as my personal server, which means that all uploads through it will be reflected here. These uploads will update every time I push unless I remember to disable it. If you're truly that curious with my personal uploads, you can [view the site here (media.dateanthony.com)](https://media.dateanthony.com/) that is hooked up to an external stylesheet. I really have my work cut out for me, huh?
### *Todo*
* Make a standard stylesheet not attached to dateanthony
* Duplicate repl and remove contents of file_uploads
* Have a jolly grand 'ol time relearning half this shit
